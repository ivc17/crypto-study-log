export const ethMerge=`The Merge was the joining of the original execution layer of Ethereum (the Mainnet that has existed since [genesis](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#frontier)) with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain. It eliminated the need for energy-intensive mining and instead enabled the the network to be secured using staked ETH. It was a truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum visionâ€”more scalability, security, and sustainability.


# The Merge

-   Ethereum Mainnet uses proof-of-stake, but this wasn't always the case.
-   The upgrade from the original proof-of-work mechanism to proof-of-stake was called The Merge.
-   The Merge refers to the original Ethereum Mainnet merging with a separate proof-of-stake blockchain called the Beacon Chain, now existing as one chain.
-   The Merge reduced Ethereum's energy consumption by ~99.95%.


Initially, the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) shipped separately from [Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#mainnet). Ethereum Mainnet - with all it's accounts, balances, smart contracts, and blockchain state - continued to be secured by [proof-of-work](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/), even while the Beacon Chain ran in parallel using [proof-of-stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/). The Merge was when these two systems finally came together, and proof-of-work was permanently replaced by proof-of-stake.

The Merge represented the official switch to using the Beacon Chain as the engine of block production. Mining is no longer the means of producing valid blocks. Instead, the proof-of-stake validators have adopted this role and are now responsible for processing the validity of all transactions and proposing blocks.

No history was lost in The Merge. As Mainnet merged with the Beacon Chain, it also merged the entire transactional history of Ethereum.
