Web3 ,the latest iteration of the Internet is expected to allow users to not only consume and create content and data but also own it.


### Web1
Web1, also known as Web 1.0, is the original Internet. 
made up of pages of static HTML that ***displayed information online***.
Web1 ran on a fully decentralized infrastructure : anyone could host a server, build applications, and publish information on the Internet without gatekeepers censoring them. 
Users of Web1 could search for information on the net via web browsers. 

Drawbacks of Web1
- no way for people to change information 
- few opportunities for interaction with others. 
- could only communicate via simple chat messengers and forums.
- users interacted with Web1 mainly as observers, not participants.


### Web2
-  [centralized](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/centralized), focused on content creation, and largely monopolized by big, successful tech companies.

In the late 1990s, databases, server-side processing, forms, and social media collectively formed a more interactive Internet known as Web2, or Web2.0. 

Web2-centric companies have reaped the benefits of this Internet revolution. 
- Companies have also built a large database of users. 
- Bigger companies like Google and Facebook have bought over smaller ones, accumulating a central global network of users and their data.

Drawbacks of Web2
- big Internet companies can utlize user data to keep them in their respective ecosystems. 
- producing targeted ads for consumers
- preventing communication among different platforms
- users are often inclined to continue using their services
- censorship
- data tracking
-  data ownership 
- user data seems to belong to companies in Web2 rather than the users themselves. W
- i.e users had their accounts closed after unknowingly violating platform-internal community guidelines. 
- personal data collected without usersâ€™ consent. 


combining the benefits of Web1 and Web2: decentralization and user participation.  the core concepts of this version of the Internet, known as Web3, have largely been defined.



## Web3
Using [peer-to-peer (P2P)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/peer-to-peer-networks-explained) technologies like blockchain, virtual reality (VR), the [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-use-cases-the-internet-of-things), and [open-source software](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/open-source-software-oss), Web3 aims to dilute the power held by huge Web2 companies. With decentralization, users can hopefully take back control of their content and ownership of their data. 

### Key features of Web3

**Decentralized:** 
- returning data control to users
- companies would have to pay to access their data
- make native crypto payments accessible to anyone
- eliminate the need for the expensive intermediaries in Web2 payment infrastructure.

**Permissionless:**  anyone can freely interact with others in Web3.

**Trustless:** The network Web3 is based on would allow users to participate without trusting anything but the network itself. 


These ideals will be supported largely by blockchain and crypto.
