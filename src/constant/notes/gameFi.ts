export const gameFi=`GameFi refers games that offer economic incentives to players . 
- play-to-earn games blockchain
- players usually can earn cryptocurrency and NFT rewards through game mechanisms i.e battle with other players, level up, completing tasks.

### Unlike traditional video games, most blockchain games let players transfer the gaming items out of the game’s virtual world. This allows players to trade their items on NFT marketplaces and their crypto earnings on crypto exchanges.



## Play-to-earn model (P2E)

It is a revolutionary gaming mode that is quite different from the traditional pay-to-play model. 
- Pay-to-play requires investment before playing. 
- Tratraditional video games won’t generate any financial returns to players.
-  in-game assets are controlled and held by the gaming company.
-  P2E games "can"  give players full control over their in-game assets 
-  P2E games offer gamers opportunities to make money playing the game.

**Blockchain technology can (and should) give players full control over their in-game assets, but that’s not always the case. Make sure you understand how the game works and who is behind the project before getting into a P2E game.
