A blockchain bridge is a protocol connecting two blockchains to enable interactions between them.  For example if you want to use your bitcoin on Ethereum, a blockchain bridge allows you to do that without selling your bitcoin. Blockchain bridges are fundamental to achieving interoperability within the blockchain space.

## Introduction

To understand what a blockchain bridge is, you need to first understand what a blockchain is. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB Smart Chain are some of the major blockchain ecosystems, all relying on different consensus protocols, programming languages, and system rules. 

A blockchain bridge is a protocol connecting two economically and technologically separate blockchains to enable interactions between them. These protocols function like a physical bridge linking one island to another, with the islands being separate blockchain ecosystems.

Thus, blockchain bridges enable what is called interoperability, meaning that digital assets and data hosted on one blockchain can interact with another. Interoperability is the cornerstone of the internet: Machines worldwide use the same set of open protocols to talk to each other. In the blockchain space, where there are many distinct protocols, blockchain bridges are essential to enabling a similar ease of exchanging data and value.
